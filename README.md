# FarmSim

A cozy 3D farming and life-sim game set in a retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic world. You wake from decades of cryosleep under an overgrown homestead. Humans have almost vanished, and robots carry on with the jobs people gave them. You bring the farm back to life, help the robot town next door, and slowly push out into the wasteland.

Built with **Unreal Engine 5.7** (C++ first, Blueprints for content) and **Blender**.

> **Status: early prototype.** You can till, plant, water, sleep and harvest on a small field, with a day/night clock and saving. The next goal is a one-season vertical slice. See the [roadmap](Docs/Roadmap.md).

## Getting started

You need Windows 10 or 11, Unreal Engine 5.7, Git with **Git LFS**, and Visual Studio 2022 for C++ work.

```
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/DunderGG/FarmSim.git
```

Then double-click `FarmSim.uproject`, let Unreal build the C++ modules, open `Content/Maps/L_Farm` and press **Play**. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the full setup, the controls and troubleshooting.
