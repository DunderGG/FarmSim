# Setting up Project Vestige on a new PC

Step by step, from a fresh Windows install to a built project, passing tests and the farm running in the editor. Follow it in order: later steps use files from earlier ones (Visual Studio reads its component list from the cloned repository, for example).

The versions here are the ones the project is built with today. When one changes, this document changes in the same commit.

## 1. What you need

### Which steps you need

| You want to... | Steps |
|---|---|
| Play the prototype and change content in the editor (levels, data assets, Blueprints) | 1 to 9 |
| Write C++ | All of 1 to 10 |
| Make 3D art | 1 to 9, and 11 |

Every path needs a C++ compiler: the project has its own C++ module, and the launcher's engine ships no compiled copy of it. Without Visual Studio's compiler, the editor can't open the project.

### Hardware

- **Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.** The project is developed and built on Windows only.
- **A DirectX 12 graphics card that supports Shader Model 6**, with current drivers. The project renders with DirectX 12 and SM6 (`Config/DefaultEngine.ini`). The *Epic* scalability level also uses hardware ray tracing, which needs a ray-tracing card; *High*, the default, doesn't.
- **RAM:** Epic recommends 32 GB for Unreal Engine 5. 16 GB works for this small project, with slower builds.
- **Disk:** an SSD with **at least 100 GB free**. The engine takes about 35 GB, Visual Studio about 17 GB plus shared Windows components, and the project folder grows to around 10 GB once it has build files and the shader cache. Engine debug symbols (optional, [step 4](#4-unreal-engine-57)) add a lot more.

Epic's full list is in [Hardware and software specifications](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/hardware-and-software-specifications-for-unreal-engine).

### Accounts

- A **GitHub** account, to fork the repository and open pull requests.
- An **Epic Games** account, for the Epic Games Launcher and the engine. Both are free.

### Time

The downloads are large. Start the engine download in [step 4](#4-unreal-engine-57) as early as you can and do the other steps while it runs. The first build and the first editor start (shaders) take another 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the PC.

## 2. Git and Git LFS

All binary files (`.uasset`, `.umap`, `.fbx`, `.blend`, textures, audio and fonts; the full list is in `.gitattributes`) live in **Git LFS** (Large File Storage). Without it, a clone has small text "pointer" files where the assets should be, and the editor can't open them.

1. Install **[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)**. The default options are fine. Its installer includes Git LFS.
2. Open a new command prompt or PowerShell window and turn LFS on for your user, once:

   ```
   git lfs install
   ```

   It prints `Git LFS initialized.`
3. Check both are there:

   ```
   git --version
   git lfs version
   ```

4. Tell Git who you are, if you haven't on this PC. Your commits carry this name and email:

   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   ```

A graphical Git client (GitHub Desktop, the one built into Visual Studio, or another) is fine on top of this, but install Git for Windows anyway: Unreal's build tools and these steps use it.

## 3. Get the project

**Contributors** work in a fork: on [the repository's GitHub page](https://github.com/DunderGG/ProjectVestige), press *Fork*, then clone your fork. **The maintainer** clones the main repository directly.

Pick a short path without unusual characters. Unreal has trouble with very long paths, and some tools with non-English characters in them. `C:\Unreal Projects\Vestige` is what the maintainer uses, and the examples below use it; replace it with your own path.

```
cd "C:\Unreal Projects"
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-name>/ProjectVestige.git Vestige
cd Vestige
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DunderGG/ProjectVestige.git
```

The `upstream` remote is only for forks: it lets you pull the maintainer's latest work later ([step 12](#12-staying-up-to-date)).

**Check that the assets came down:**

```
git lfs ls-files
```

Every file in the list should have a `*` after its ID; a `-` means only the pointer is there. Or look at a file such as `Art/Blender/FarmAssets.blend` in Explorer: it should be well over 1 KB. If the files are pointers, run:

```
git lfs pull
```

## 4. Unreal Engine 5.7

The project is on **Unreal Engine 5.7** (`"EngineAssociation": "5.7"` in `Vestige.uproject`). Any 5.7 hotfix release works; the maintainer is on 5.7.3. **Don't open it with another engine version.** 5.6 or 5.8 offer to convert the project, which rewrites assets so they no longer open in 5.7 for anyone else.

1. Install the **[Epic Games Launcher](https://store.epicgames.com/download)** and sign in.
2. Go to **Unreal Engine > Library**. Next to *Engine Versions*, press **+**, choose **5.7.x** in the new slot, and press **Install**.
3. In the install options, choose:

   | Option | Choice | Why |
   |---|---|---|
   | Core Components | Yes (required) | The engine itself |
   | Starter Content | No | The project doesn't use it |
   | Templates and Feature Packs | No | The template content the project started from is already in the repository |
   | Engine Source | Yes | Lets Visual Studio show the engine's `.cpp` files when you go to a definition, which is the best documentation Unreal has |
   | Editor symbols for debugging | Optional | Large. Only needed to step into engine code in the debugger, or for readable engine call stacks in crash reports. You can add it later from the same menu |
   | Target platforms (Android, iOS, Linux...) | No | The project only builds for Windows |

   You can install to another drive with *Browse*; the rest of this guide assumes the default, `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7`.
4. Let it download and install. Carry on with [step 5](#5-visual-studio) meanwhile, but don't open the project yet.

The launcher also registers `.uproject` files with Windows, which [step 6](#6-generate-the-project-files-and-build) needs for its right-click menu.

## 5. Visual Studio

Unreal compiles C++ with Microsoft's compiler (MSVC), which comes with Visual Studio. **Visual Studio 2026 Community** (free) is what the maintainer uses, and its clang-format is the project's reference formatter ([step 10](#10-code-formatting)). Visual Studio 2022, version 17.14, also works with UE 5.7.

Unreal 5.7 is picky about compiler versions: it wants the **MSVC 14.44** toolset (the long-term version from Visual Studio 2022 17.14), and refuses some others because of compiler bugs. Visual Studio 2026 installs a newer toolset by default, so 14.44 has to be added. The repository's **`.vsconfig`** file lists everything needed, so you don't have to pick components by hand.

1. Download **[Visual Studio 2026 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)** and run the installer.
2. On the *Workloads* tab, tick **Game development with C++**. In its optional components on the right, leave the *Unreal Engine installer* unticked (the Epic Games Launcher installs the engine). Install.
3. When it's done, open the **Visual Studio Installer** again (Start menu). Next to Visual Studio 2026, press **More > Import configuration**, choose the `.vsconfig` file in the project folder from [step 3](#3-get-the-project), and press **Review details**, then **Modify**. This adds the rest of the components below.
4. Restart Windows if the installer asks.

What `.vsconfig` installs, in case you want to check or pick by hand (in the installer's *Individual components* tab, search for the version number):

| Component | What it's for |
|---|---|
| Workloads: Game development with C++, Desktop development with C++, .NET desktop development, Visual Studio core editor | The C++ compiler and tools, and the .NET parts Unreal's build tools use |
| MSVC **14.44** build tools for x64/x86, and the matching ATL | The compiler UE 5.7 prefers |
| MSVC 14.38 build tools for x64/x86, and the matching ATL | The oldest compiler UE 5.7 accepts, as a fallback |
| MSVC build tools, latest (`VC.Tools.x86.x64`) | The default toolset |
| **Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0)** | The Windows SDK version UE 5.7 is built against |
| C++ Clang tools for Windows (`VC.Llvm.Clang`) | Includes the `clang-format.exe` the project formats code with |
| .NET Framework 4.6.2 targeting pack | Used by some of the engine's tools |
| IDE support for Unreal Engine, and the Unreal Engine debugger | Visual Studio's Unreal integration: Unreal-aware code browsing and debugging |

The same list comes from the engine itself, in `Engine\Config\Windows\Windows_SDK.json` under `VisualStudioSuggestedComponents`. If a future engine hotfix changes it, update `.vsconfig` and this table to match.

**Rider instead of Visual Studio.** JetBrains Rider works with Unreal and reads the repository's `.editorconfig` and `.clang-format`. It still needs the Microsoft compiler and Windows SDK: install the *Build Tools for Visual Studio* and import `.vsconfig` there in the same way. When Rider offers to install its *RiderLink* plugin, install it **into the engine**, not into the project, so it doesn't end up in the repository. Open `Vestige.uproject` directly in Rider and skip the solution steps below. This guide only describes Visual Studio in detail.

## 6. Generate the project files and build

The repository holds no Visual Studio solution: `Vestige.sln` is generated from the source folders and `Vestige.uproject`, and is ignored by Git.

1. Wait for the engine install from [step 4](#4-unreal-engine-57) to finish.
2. In Explorer, right-click **`Vestige.uproject`** and choose **Generate Visual Studio project files**. On Windows 11 the entry is under *Show more options*. A small window shows progress; `Vestige.sln` appears next to the `.uproject`.
3. Double-click **`Vestige.sln`** to open it in Visual Studio. If a yellow bar says components are missing, press *Install* and let it add them.
4. In the toolbar, set the configuration to **Development Editor** and the platform to **Win64**.
5. In *Solution Explorer*, open *Games*, right-click **Vestige** and choose **Set as Startup Project**.
6. Right-click **Vestige** again and choose **Build**. The first build compiles the whole module and takes a few minutes; later builds only compile what changed. The *Output* window ends with `Build: 1 succeeded`.

The build must finish **with no errors and no warnings**. The project treats some warnings as errors, for example a local variable that hides a class member ([CodingGuidelines.md, section 2.4](CodingGuidelines.md#24-never-shadow)).

**The same from the command line.** Useful when the right-click entry is missing, or for scripts. In a command prompt:

```
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat" -projectfiles -project="C:\Unreal Projects\Vestige\Vestige.uproject" -game -rocket -progress
```

generates the project files, and

```
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat" VestigeEditor Win64 Development -Project="C:\Unreal Projects\Vestige\Vestige.uproject" -WaitMutex
```

builds the editor target. It ends with `Result: Succeeded`. The first lines of the log name the compiler and Windows SDK it picked; for UE 5.7 they should say `14.44` and `10.0.22621.0`.

## 7. Open the editor

- **From Visual Studio:** press **F5** (start with the debugger) or **Ctrl+F5** (without). This is the usual way when you work on C++: a crash then stops in the debugger on the line that caused it.
- **Without Visual Studio:** double-click `Vestige.uproject`, or open it from the launcher's *Unreal Engine > Library > My Projects*.

Always open it one of these ways. Starting the editor on its own and letting it open the last project can show a misleading "modules were built with a different engine version" message.

**The first start is slow.** The editor compiles thousands of shaders and fills the local cache (`DerivedDataCache/`). The counter at the bottom right of the editor shows the shaders left; wait for it to finish before judging how the game looks or runs. Later starts take seconds.

If the editor says **"The following modules are missing or built with a different engine version: Vestige. Would you like to rebuild them now?"**, press *Yes*. That builds the module without Visual Studio open, which is fine for content work. If the rebuild fails, build from Visual Studio as in [step 6](#6-generate-the-project-files-and-build): it shows the real error.

If Visual Studio shows a message about a *Visual Studio Integration Tool* plugin, leave it: the plugin is turned off in `Vestige.uproject` on purpose, and turning it on changes a file every contributor shares.

## 8. Run the automated tests

The game rules have automated tests, named `Vestige.*`. Run them once now to know your setup is sound, and before every change you submit.

- **In the editor:** *Tools > Test Automation*. In the *Automation* tab, type `Vestige` in the search box, tick the `Vestige` group and press **Start Tests**. Every test turns green.
- **From the command line**, with the editor closed:

  ```
  "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe" "C:\Unreal Projects\Vestige\Vestige.uproject" -ExecCmds="Automation RunTests Vestige; Quit" -unattended -nopause -nullrhi -nosplash -testexit="Automation Test Queue Empty"
  ```

  Every test logs `Result={Success}`. Two `LogAutomationTest: Error: Condition failed` lines at startup come from the engine and can be ignored.

How to write tests is in [CodingGuidelines.md, section 13](CodingGuidelines.md#13-testing).

## 9. Play it

1. In the editor's *Content Browser*, open `Content/Maps` and double-click **`L_Farm`**.
2. Press **Play** (Alt+P).
3. The controls are in [CONTRIBUTING.md, Controls](../CONTRIBUTING.md#controls). Till the grass, plant seeds, water them, sleep and harvest.

[PlayTest.md](PlayTest.md) is the reference for checking the game by hand: how to test, where saves and logs are, and a five-minute smoke test of every system. Running that smoke test once is a good way to see that everything works and to learn the game.

## 10. Code formatting

The repository's **`.clang-format`** formats C++ to the project's rules. The **reference formatter is the clang-format that ships with Visual Studio 2026** (version 22.1). Other versions can differ in small details; when they disagree, that one wins.

1. In Visual Studio: *Tools > Options > Text Editor > C/C++ > Code Style > Formatting*, tick **Enable ClangFormat support**. Leave *Use custom clang-format.exe file* off, so Visual Studio uses its own copy, which is the reference version.
2. Format the files you change with **Ctrl+K, Ctrl+D**. Don't reformat files you didn't otherwise change.
3. From the command line, the same formatter is at:

   ```
   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin\clang-format.exe" -i Source\Vestige\Farming\FarmTile.cpp
   ```

   It is installed by the *C++ Clang tools* component from `.vsconfig`. Check its version with `--version`. Visual Studio 2022 has its own, older copy under `Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\`; if you format with it, look out for changes outside the lines you edited, and undo them.

The repository's `.editorconfig` also makes Visual Studio flag names that break Epic's prefixes (`A`, `U`, `F`, `b`...). The rules themselves are in [CodingGuidelines.md](CodingGuidelines.md).

## 11. Blender (art only)

Only needed to make or change 3D models.

1. Install the current release of **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)**. Any 4.x or 5.x release works with the project's script; the maintainer uses 5.0.
2. Open the sources in `Art/Blender/`. The export settings, scale, pivots and naming are in [CONTRIBUTING.md, Contributing art](../CONTRIBUTING.md#5-contributing-art).
3. `Art/Blender/make_farm_assets.py` builds the current crop and tool meshes from a script and exports them to `Art/Export/`. From the project folder:

   ```
   blender --background --python Art/Blender/make_farm_assets.py
   ```

   If `blender` isn't found, use its full path, for example `"C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 5.0\blender.exe"`.

`.blend1` backup files are ignored by Git, and `.blend` and `.fbx` files go through Git LFS automatically.

## 12. Staying up to date

When you pull new work, from `origin` or from the maintainer's `upstream`:

```
git pull
```

LFS files come down with the pull. Then:

- **New or moved source files:** generate the project files again ([step 6](#6-generate-the-project-files-and-build)), so Visual Studio shows them.
- **Any C++ change:** close the editor and build `VestigeEditor` (Development Editor, Win64) before opening it. *Live Coding* (Ctrl+Alt+F11 in the editor) only patches function bodies; it can't add classes, `UPROPERTY`s or `UFUNCTION`s.
- **Run the tests** ([step 8](#8-run-the-automated-tests)), and work through the *Pending checks* in [PlayTest.md](PlayTest.md#2-pending-checks).

To update a fork from the maintainer's repository:

```
git fetch upstream
git switch main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

## 13. When something goes wrong

| What you see | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| The editor says assets are missing, corrupt or "unknown file version", or `.uasset` files are a few hundred bytes | Git LFS wasn't set up before cloning, so only pointer files came down. Run `git lfs install`, then `git lfs pull` in the project folder |
| No *Generate Visual Studio project files* entry when right-clicking `Vestige.uproject` | On Windows 11, look under *Show more options*. If it still isn't there, `.uproject` files aren't registered: open the Epic Games Launcher once, or use the command line in [step 6](#6-generate-the-project-files-and-build) |
| "Vestige could not be compiled. Try rebuilding from source manually." | The automatic build failed. Build from Visual Studio ([step 6](#6-generate-the-project-files-and-build)) and read the first error in the *Output* window. It is usually a missing Visual Studio component: import `.vsconfig` again |
| The build log says no suitable compiler was found, or warns that the compiler version isn't preferred or is banned | The MSVC 14.44 toolset or the Windows 11 SDK 10.0.22621 is missing, or an old 14.44 preview is installed. Import `.vsconfig` again and update Visual Studio |
| "Unable to build while Live Coding is active" | The editor is open. Close it, or press Ctrl+Alt+F11 in the editor to apply the change with Live Coding (function bodies only) |
| The editor offers to convert the project to another engine version | You opened it with the wrong engine. Press *Cancel*, and open it with 5.7 ([step 4](#4-unreal-engine-57)). Never convert the project |
| "Modules were built with a different engine version" on a project that just built | The editor was started on its own and auto-opened the project. Close it and open `Vestige.uproject` directly ([step 7](#7-open-the-editor)) |
| A warning about a variable that "hides class member" stops the build | That warning is an error in this project. Rename your local variable ([CodingGuidelines.md, section 2.4](CodingGuidelines.md#24-never-shadow)) |
| The game looks wrong or grey right after the first start | Shaders are still compiling (the counter at the bottom right of the editor). Wait for it to finish |
| Visual Studio's *Error List* shows red errors, but the build succeeds | IntelliSense doesn't fully understand Unreal's macros. Trust the *Output* window. Generating the project files again often clears them |
| Something else | Check the log in `Saved/Logs/Vestige.log` (the editor's *Window > Output Log* shows the same). If you're stuck, open an issue with the log attached, as [CONTRIBUTING.md, section 8](../CONTRIBUTING.md#8-ideas-bugs-and-feedback) describes |
