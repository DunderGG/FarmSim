# Contributing to Project Vestige

Thanks for wanting to help. Project Vestige is a cozy 3D farming and life-sim game, built with Unreal Engine 5 and Blender. It is an early prototype made by one developer, so there is plenty to do and plenty of room to shape it.

This guide covers how to get the project running, how it is organized, and how to contribute code, art, audio and ideas.

> **Licensing in short:** code is GPL-3.0-or-later with a permission for Unreal Engine, assets are CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (no commercial use except by the maintainer), and the maintainer (David, [@DunderGG](https://github.com/DunderGG)) sells official builds of the game whose code stays under the GPL. Contributors are credited. Read [Licensing and credit](#11-licensing-and-credit) before your first contribution.

## 1. Ways to help

| Area | Examples | Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **Gameplay code** | New tools, crops that need special rules, an inventory, shops, NPCs | C++, Unreal Engine |
| **3D art** | Crops at each growth stage, tools, buildings, fences, trees, props | Blender, low-poly modeling |
| **Materials and textures** | Soil, grass, wood, stylized materials | Unreal materials, texturing |
| **Animation** | Tool swings, watering, harvesting | Blender or Unreal animation |
| **UI** | HUD, inventory, menus, icons | Unreal UMG/Slate, 2D art |
| **Audio** | Footsteps, tool sounds, ambience, music | Sound design, composing |
| **Content and balancing** | New crops and items defined as data, prices, growth times | Unreal editor, no code needed |
| **Testing** | Playing builds and reporting bugs, writing automated tests | Patience, C++ for tests |
| **Documentation** | Fixing unclear docs, writing how-tos | Writing |
| **Mods** | Building content as a mod, to test that the game is moddable | Unreal editor, Blueprints |

## 2. Getting set up

### What you need

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | 10 or 11 | The project is developed and built on Windows |
| Unreal Engine | **5.7** | Install through the Epic Games Launcher. Other versions will ask to convert the project; don't |
| Visual Studio | 2022 | Only for C++ work. Opening the project prompts you to install the components listed in `.vsconfig` (the "Game development with C++" workload) |
| Git and **Git LFS** | Recent | All binary files (`.uasset`, `.umap`, `.fbx`, `.blend`, textures, audio) are stored in Git LFS |
| Blender | Current release | Only for 3D art |

### First run

1. Install Git LFS once: `git lfs install`.
2. Clone the repository. LFS files download with it; if you see small text files where assets should be, run `git lfs pull`.
3. Double-click **`Vestige.uproject`**. The first time, Unreal offers to build the C++ modules; say yes. This takes a few minutes.
   - If you will write C++, right-click `Vestige.uproject` and pick *Generate Visual Studio project files* first, then open `Vestige.sln` and build the **VestigeEditor** target in **Development Editor / Win64**.
   - Always open the project through `Vestige.uproject` or the launcher's *My Projects* list. Opening the editor on its own and letting it auto-load the project can show a misleading "modules were built with a different engine version" error.
4. Open the level **`Content/Maps/L_Farm`** and press **Play**.

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| WASD, mouse | Move, look |
| Space | Jump |
| 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 | Hoe / seeds / watering can / hand |
| E | Use the current tool on the tile in front of you |
| N | Sleep to the next day (the game saves) |
| F9 | Delete the save and start a new game |

Till the grass, plant seeds, water them each day, sleep, and harvest when the crop is ripe.

## 3. Finding your way around

```
ProjectVestige/
    Vestige.uproject        The Unreal project
    Source/Vestige/         Game C++ code (one module, in folders by layer; see CodingGuidelines.md 14.1)
    Content/                Unreal assets
        Farm/               Our game assets (meshes, materials, Blueprints)
        Maps/               Levels (L_Farm is the main one)
        Characters/, ThirdPerson/, Input/
                            From Epic's Third Person template
    Art/
        Blender/            Blender source files and scripts
        Export/             FBX files exported from Blender, ready to import
    Config/                 Engine and project settings
    Docs/                   Project documentation
```

Read these before making larger changes:

- **[Docs/Architecture.md](Docs/Architecture.md)**: how the game is structured, which class owns what, the design rules, and why decisions were made. Its *Known gaps* and *Expected changes* sections are a good list of things that need doing.
- **[Docs/CodingGuidelines.md](Docs/CodingGuidelines.md)**: how code should look, naming for code and assets, testing.
- **[Docs/Systems.md](Docs/Systems.md)**: how each game system is built, following Epic's recommendations and the Lyra sample. Read the guide for the system you're working on.

## 4. Contributing code

1. **Talk first for anything bigger than a small fix.** Open an issue that describes the change and which class or system would own it. It saves you from building something that doesn't fit.
2. **Follow the architecture.** The most important rule: every actor, component and subsystem has one job, and new logic goes on the class whose job it is. If nothing fits, propose a new class. See [Architecture.md](Docs/Architecture.md).
3. **Follow the coding guidelines.** Epic's naming (`AFarm...`, `UFarm...`, `bIsSomething`), tabs and braces on their own lines, small functions, no magic numbers. The repo's `.clang-format` handles formatting: enable *ClangFormat support* in Visual Studio and format the files you change.
4. **Keep it fast.** Performance is a requirement: no ticking without a reason, no per-frame polling or searching, soft references for content and no loading during play. See [Performance](Docs/CodingGuidelines.md#12-performance) and the [budget](Docs/Architecture.md#10-performance-by-design).
5. **Build for mods.** Content (crops, tools, items) is data, not hard-coded lists or enums. See [Designing for mods](Docs/Architecture.md#12-designing-for-mods).
6. **Test it.** Game rule changes come with automated tests (CQTest, in `Source/Vestige/Tests/`). Run the `Vestige` tests from the editor's Test Automation window, and play the change in the editor.
7. **No new warnings.** The build treats some warnings as errors, for example a local variable that hides a member (`Mesh` inside a character class).
8. **Update the docs.** If your change adds a system, moves a responsibility or makes a design choice, update `Docs/Architecture.md` (the ownership table and the decision log) in the same pull request.

## 5. Contributing art

### Style

Low-poly and stylized, with simple shapes and flat or lightly textured colors. Look at the existing crops and the watering can in `Content/Farm/Meshes` for reference. Readability from the game camera matters more than detail.

### From Blender to Unreal

1. **Scale:** Blender in metric with unit scale 1.0, so 1 Blender meter is 1 Unreal meter (100 Unreal units). A farm tile is **1 m × 1 m**.
2. **Orientation:** Z up, and the front of the object facing **+X**.
3. **Origins (pivots)** are where the object touches the world or is held:
   - Soil and ground pieces: bottom center.
   - Crops: center of the base, on the soil surface.
   - Held tools: the point where the hand grips.
4. **Apply transforms** (rotation and scale) before exporting.
5. **Export FBX** to `Art/Export/` with the same name the asset will have in Unreal, using *Forward: X*, *Up: Z* and *Apply Scalings: FBX Units Scale*.
6. **Save the `.blend` source** in `Art/Blender/`. Every imported mesh should have its source in the repo so others can change it.
7. **Import** into `Content/Farm/` in the folder for its type (`Meshes`, `Materials`, `Textures`...).

`Art/Blender/make_farm_assets.py` generates the current crop and tool meshes from a script and is a working example of these settings.

### Naming

Follow Epic's [recommended asset naming](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/recommended-asset-naming-conventions-in-unreal-engine-projects): `SM_` static mesh, `SK_` skeletal mesh, `M_` material, `MI_` material instance, `T_` texture, `BP_` Blueprint and so on. Variants go at the end: `SM_Crop_Stage0`, `SM_Crop_Ripe`. The full table is in [CodingGuidelines.md](Docs/CodingGuidelines.md#142-content-and-asset-naming).

### Budgets

Keep things light so big farms stay fast: a crop or small prop in the hundreds of triangles, a tool under about 2,000, a building under about 10,000. Textures 1024 × 1024 or smaller unless there's a reason. Going over one needs a reason in the pull request. Small props and crops also don't cast dynamic shadows unless they visibly need to, and swaying plants keep their movement subtle and switch it off at a distance. The reasons are in [Architecture.md, Performance by design](Docs/Architecture.md#10-performance-by-design).

## 6. Contributing audio

- Deliver **WAV**, 16-bit or 24-bit, 44.1 or 48 kHz. Mono for sounds placed in the world, stereo for music and ambience.
- Name sound waves `S_<Name>` and sound cues `SC_<Name>`, and put them in `Content/Farm/Audio/`.
- Keep the source project files (DAW sessions, raw recordings) out of the repo unless they're needed to edit the sound later. Ask first if they are large.

## 7. Adding content the data-driven way

The goal is that adding a crop, tool or item means adding data, not changing C++. That's also how mods will add content.

The data asset types for this (`UFarmCropData` and friends) are planned but not built yet; see [Expected changes](Docs/Architecture.md#18-expected-changes). Building them is a good first contribution for a C++ developer. Once they exist, this section will explain step by step how to add a crop.

## 8. Ideas, bugs and feedback

- **Bugs:** open an issue with what you did, what you expected, what happened, and the engine version. Attach the log from `Saved/Logs/Vestige.log` and a screenshot if it helps.
- **Ideas:** open an issue describing the idea and why it would make the game better. Small, concrete ideas are easiest to act on.
- **Questions:** open an issue too. If something in the docs confused you, that's a bug in the docs.
- **Security problems:** report them privately, not as an issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## 9. Git workflow and pull requests

1. Fork the repository, or create a branch if you have write access. Name the branch after the change: `add-fence-meshes`, `fix-watering-twice`.
2. Make **small, focused commits** with clear messages: an imperative subject line under about 70 characters ("Add fence meshes"), a blank line, then what changed and why.
3. Keep moves and renames in their own commits, separate from changes in behavior.
4. **Never commit** `Binaries/`, `Intermediate/`, `Saved/`, `DerivedDataCache/`, `.vs/` or generated `.sln` files. `.gitignore` handles this; don't force-add them.
5. **Binary files go through Git LFS.** `.gitattributes` covers the common types. If you add a new binary file type, add it to `.gitattributes` in the same commit.
6. **Avoid editing the same binary asset as someone else.** `.uasset` and `.umap` files can't be merged. Say in your issue which assets and levels you'll be changing, especially `L_Farm`.
7. Open a **pull request** against `main`. Describe what it changes and how you tested it, and include screenshots or a short clip for anything visual.
8. The maintainer reviews every pull request. Expect questions and requests for changes; they're about keeping the project consistent, not about you.

Before opening a pull request, check:

- [ ] It builds, and the `Vestige` tests pass.
- [ ] You played it in the editor and it works.
- [ ] Code follows the [coding guidelines](Docs/CodingGuidelines.md#17-review-checklist) and the [architecture](Docs/Architecture.md).
- [ ] Assets are named correctly, and their Blender sources are included.
- [ ] Docs are updated if the design changed.
- [ ] Third-party material is listed with its source and license (see [Third-party material](#third-party-material)), and new source files start with the license header from [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md#license-notices-in-files).
- [ ] You agree to the [contributor terms](#contributor-terms).

## 10. Working with AI tools

You're welcome to use AI coding assistants. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (and `CLAUDE.md`, which loads it) gives them the project's rules. You are still responsible for what you submit: read and understand every change, build it and test it before opening a pull request.

## 11. Licensing and credit

Project Vestige's code is licensed under the **GPL-3.0-or-later** with an [additional permission](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.txt) that allows linking with Unreal Engine and platform SDKs. Its assets and documentation are under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**, which doesn't allow commercial use. The maintainer sells official builds of the game, and their code stays under the GPL. The full picture, and which license applies to which folder, is in [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).

### Contributor terms

These terms are version 2, dated 2026-10-28. They apply to every pull request to this repository. Contributions are accepted only as pull requests; please don't send code or assets by email, chat or issue attachment. Ideas and suggestions in issues and discussions are welcome, and aren't contributions under these terms. If one turns into code or art, it comes in as a pull request.

When you open a pull request, you agree that:

1. **You have the right to submit it.** The contribution is your own work, or you have the right to submit it under these terms (for example, your employer allows it). You have listed every third-party part with its source and license, as described under [Third-party material](#third-party-material).
2. **It is licensed to everyone** under the license for the part of the repository it goes into: GPL-3.0-or-later with the additional permission in [LICENSE-EXCEPTION.txt](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.txt) for code, and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for assets, documentation and everything else. [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md#which-license-applies-where) says which is which.
3. **The maintainer may use it in official builds.** You also grant David Bennehag, the maintainer, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, copy, modify and distribute your contribution as part of official Project Vestige builds, including commercial builds sold on game stores and consoles. This includes accepting the terms a store or platform sets for publishing there, and letting people who work on official builds for him (for example a porting studio or a publisher) do the same, under the same limits.
4. **Official builds stay GPL.** The grant in point 3 doesn't let anyone distribute your code under closed-source terms. The Project Vestige code in every official build stays under the GPL with the additional permission, and its source is published in this repository. The grant only adds what CC BY-NC-SA doesn't allow: commercial use of your assets in official builds.
5. **You keep the copyright** to your work and may use it elsewhere however you like.

Tick the contributor terms box in the pull request template. Pull requests are merged only when the box is ticked, and the pull request is the record of your agreement and of the terms version you agreed to. If you submitted something you didn't have the right to submit, say so in the pull request or an issue, and it will be removed.

### Credit

Add yourself to [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) in your first pull request. Contributors are also listed in the game's credits.

### Third-party material

Only submit code and assets you made yourself, or third-party material under one of these licenses:

| Kind | Accepted | Not accepted |
|---|---|---|
| Code | MIT, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, Apache-2.0, zlib, BSL-1.0, public domain or CC0 | Any GPL, LGPL or AGPL code (its authors haven't given the Unreal Engine permission, so we couldn't ship builds), and any license with a non-commercial or "no modification" clause |
| Assets (models, textures, fonts, audio, music) | CC0, public domain, CC BY 4.0, and font licenses such as the SIL Open Font License | Anything non-commercial (NC), no-derivatives (ND), ShareAlike under a different license (for example CC BY-SA), "free for personal use", editorial-only, or with an unclear source |
| Documentation | Your own writing; short quotes with a source | Copied text from other sites or books |

For each third-party file:

- Say in the pull request where it came from (a link), who made it and its license.
- Add it to the third-party list in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md#third-party) with the same details, and keep any license or attribution file the license requires next to it.
- If you're not sure the license allows a commercial game, don't submit it; ask in an issue first.

**AI-generated material** is treated like third-party material: say which tool made it and what you gave it, and make sure the tool's terms allow use in a commercial game. Never submit anything generated from, or imitating, someone else's protected work. The maintainer may decline AI-generated material whose origin is unclear.

Never submit code or assets ripped from other games.

## 12. Be kind

Be respectful and patient with everyone. People of every skill level are welcome. Critique the work, not the person.
